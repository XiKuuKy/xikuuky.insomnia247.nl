<h1 id="programming-for-the-sysadmin">Programming for the Sysadmin</h1>
<p>Using programming to quickly glue tools together can be incredibly useful. Certain languages are incredibly useful to administrate a system. My favorite languages to use are <code>Perl6</code>, <code>Common Lisp</code>, <code>Scheme</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Crystal</code>, <code>Racket</code>, <code>C</code> (for my WM, 2bwm) and <code>Zsh</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, I have a shell script running that runs <a href="https://github.com/facebook/watchman"><code>watchman</code></a>. It will run pandoc if I change a markdown file in my <code>~/notes</code> directory which automatically opens a HTML file when I start Firefox and shows me my current TODOs (of which write a new blog post has been there for a while).</p>
<p>The great part of doing things the ‘Unix Way’ is that you can glue a lot of code together. You could even use a tool like Watchman to automatically commit your <code>.files</code> to Github if you change a marked file. If you have your program pipe out to the command line you can even link programs. I also heavily suggest trying to manage a system in a virtual machine to try making things more lightweight, especially since you could break your system trying to do script it if you don’t know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>I’ve basically replaced most parts of the DE with different scripts. I don’t use a bar, I don’t use a desktop with icons or a file manager, I don’t even have a battery or clock icon. If I need to know the time I press <code>mod+p</code> and type in <code>notify-send "$(date)"</code> and if I need to know the battery I type <code>notify-send "$(acpi)"</code>. I even wrote a little script and put it in my <code>~/.bin</code> called <code>date</code> that includes that code and another with the script to tell me my battery status.</p>
<p>More often than not I just open up the command line if I want something done. I find most gui’s slow and cumbersome to use when I can open firefox, a terminal, run <code>alsamixer</code> then open another terminal and start coding in under 3 seconds. If I need a more complex task done quickly, I just write a script for it, put it in my bin and run it through <code>dmenu-run</code> (part of the <a href="http://suckless.org/">suckless community</a>). The biggest program on my computer that I am just unable to replace is Firefox and that’s just because I need web compatibility. I used to use Qutebrowser and I even tried lynx, links and etc but I need the ablity to watch video. I do however like to combine <code>youtube-dl</code> and <code>mpv</code> which is a must have for any personal computer system.</p>
<p>List of software I recommend 1. <code>2bwm</code> or <code>dwm</code> as a window manager 2. <code>Zsh</code> for a shell 3. <code>vim</code> or <code>emacs</code> for document editing (I use emacs with vile) 4. <code>kitty</code> or <code>termite</code> for terminal 5. <code>pandoc</code> for document conversion 6. <code>mpv</code> to watch video (and do other things) 7. <code>youtube-dl</code> to download video and audio 8. <code>ffmpeg</code> to convert between formats 9. <code>wget</code> to download anything else from the command line 10. <code>alsamixer</code> to change the volume 11. <code>dmenu</code> to interface to the computer outside of the command line (is highly extensible via patches and can be configured in C)</p>
