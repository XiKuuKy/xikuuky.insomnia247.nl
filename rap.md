Life is crushing us but we become diamonds

If you wanna suffer but become better...

arghhhhh

It feels like I'm covered in tattoos and no one can touch me

Bro come at me

I'm surpassing human quality

My body is improving constantly

My emotions are all of these and my spirituality burns like tibetan monks

Makes everyone seem like punks

I run earth while everyone plays in the dirt

America, Indonesia, it don't matter, I'm the ruler

I can do Euler broski while men act like chicks

Everyone else is a dick and fat not thicc

U can't shoot me or loot me

I'm the big kahuna, everyone else is a lil kid

I kid, I kid, until I became the GOAT!

Just think whatever floats ur boat

Cause satisfaction comes from inside

I am DEEP INSIDE ur sista! motha! family memba!

HO PRAY TO BE LIKE ME
=====================

YO COME AT ME
===============

U SAY PRAY FOR ME I SAY PLAY WITH ME
=====================================

I SAY PRAY FOR THE DAY I BEHAVE LIKE drE
==========================================

LAY U LIL GRAY GAY LOOKING PAY DAY BOOKIN UNTIL I SLAY
=====================================================

Don't be so MAINSTREAM

That's what they do they jealous that I be killing like a serial murderer

murdering these syllables with a _laugh track_ while u be backpack crap shack
