Programming for the Sysadmin
===============================

Using programming to quickly glue tools together can be incredibly useful.
Certain languages are incredibly useful to administrate a system. My favorite
languages to use are `Perl6`, `Common Lisp`, `Scheme`, `Ruby`, `Crystal`,
`Racket`, `C` (for my WM, 2bwm) and `Zsh`.

For instance, I have a shell script running that runs
[`watchman`](https://github.com/facebook/watchman). It will run pandoc if I
change a markdown file in my `~/notes` directory which automatically opens a
HTML file when I start Firefox and shows me my current TODOs (of which write a
new blog post has been there for a while).

The great part of doing things the 'Unix Way' is that you can glue a lot of code
together. You could even use a tool like Watchman to automatically commit your
`.files` to Github if you change a marked file. If you have your program pipe
out to the command line you can even link programs. I also heavily suggest
trying to manage a system in a virtual machine to try making things more
lightweight, especially since you could break your system trying to do script it
if you don't know what you're doing.

I've basically replaced most parts of the DE with different scripts. I don't use
a bar, I don't use a desktop with icons or a file manager, I don't even have a
battery or clock icon. If I need to know the time I press `mod+p` and type in
`notify-send "$(date)"` and if I need to know the battery I type `notify-send
"$(acpi)"`. I even wrote a little script and put it in my `~/.bin` called `date`
that includes that code and another with the script to tell me my battery
status.

More often than not I just open up the command line if I want something done. I
find most gui's slow and cumbersome to use when I can open firefox, a terminal,
run `alsamixer` then open another terminal and start coding in under 3 seconds.
If I need a more complex task done quickly, I just write a script for it, put it
in my bin and run it through `dmenu-run` (part of the [suckless
community](http://suckless.org/)). The biggest program on my computer that I am
just unable to replace is Firefox and that's just because I need web
compatibility. I used to use Qutebrowser and I even tried lynx, links and etc
but I need the ablity to watch video. I do however like to combine `youtube-dl`
and `mpv` which is a must have for any personal computer system.

List of software I recommend
1. `2bwm` or `dwm` as a window manager
2. `Zsh` for a shell
3. `vim` or `emacs` for document editing (I use emacs with vile)
4. `kitty` or `termite` for terminal
5. `pandoc` for document conversion
6. `mpv` to watch video (and do other things)
7. `youtube-dl` to download video and audio
8. `ffmpeg` to convert between formats
9. `wget` to download anything else from the command line
10. `alsamixer` to change the volume
11. `dmenu` to interface to the computer outside of the command line (is highly
    extensible via patches and can be configured in C)
