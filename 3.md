Writing a Simple Language
===========================

Today's article will be a tutorial on how to write a simple array based programming language. An array-based programming
language is a language which has a state stored as an array and the program can operate on this state. Our language
won't be useful for very much but might be an interesting thought experiment and will maybe be expounded on in later
articles. Our language will use verbs which is a `function` that takes x amounts of `axioms` as arguments. For the most
part we will probably only use singleton verbs (verbs that take one axiom as an argument).

I'll be writing the language in `perl6` so feel free to follow along:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
my @state; # declare an empty array to act as our state
my $path = slurp("<location of code>"); # open the full file contents of our code, make sure you give the file a path
my @program = split("", $path);

for @program -> $char {
    print $char
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most basic thing we need to do to run our program, open a file and in this case we print its contents. Now
let's replace the contents of that for loop so that it does something useful...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
for @program -> $char {
  @state.push(1) if $char ~~ "+"; # if our reader finds a `+` then add 1 to the state
  @state.push("\n") if $char ~~ "n"; # if our reader finds a `n` then add a newline
}

my $finalState = join '', @state; # put the state back together as a string
print $finalState; # output final state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now if you make your test file contain

```{.block}
+n
```

It should print `1` to the terminal. What do you think will happen if you add another `+` verbs to the file? It prints:
`11`. Okay, cool enough but what if we want it to add two things? Replace the
for block with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
for @program -> $char {
  @state.push(1) if $char ~~ "+"; # if our reader finds a `+` then add 1 to the state
  @state.push("\n") if $char ~~ "n"; # if our reader finds a `n` then add a newline
  if $char ~~ "a" { # if the reader finds a...
    @state.push(@state.pop + @state.pop); # pop the last two values then add them
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now when our reader program sees `a` it knows to add our ones together so if you
change our verb test file to:

```{.block}
++an
```

it will output, `2` with a newline. Pretty cool, eh? Okay but if I want to add a
bunch of numbers to the state then let's have a shortcut which combines the verbs
`+a` and call it `A`, see if you can figure out how to do it and then look at
the code below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
if $char ~~ "A" { # if the reader finds `A`...
  @state.push(@state.pop + 1); # pop the last value then add 1
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add that to the for-loop and try it out by changing our verb file to `+An`. It
should once again output `2`... but that isn't a very Array style of doing things
so let's change that `if A` code to this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
if $char ~~ "A" { # if the reader finds `A`...
  @state.push(1);
  @state.push(@state.pop + @state.pop); # pop the last value then add 1
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now it imitates exactly what happens if you run `+a`. Good I like that. But sadly,
in its current state, we can't write even a simple `Hello, World!` program `:(`.
Let's change that. If we can turn our numbers into letters we should be golden...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
if $char ~~ "p" { # if the reader finds `p`
  @state.push(@state.pop().chr); # push the popped value of the state to the state and turn it into a char
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

now let's make our program print 'A'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you copied the program correctly it should print 'a'... but that's very long so let's make our language able to take some shortcuts. Let's make it possible to add 5, 10, 50 and subtract 1, 5, 10 and 50

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
# add numbers, inspired by roman numerals
@state.push(5) if $char ~~ "v";
@state.push(10) if $char ~~ "x";
@state.push(50) if $char ~~ "l";

# subtract numbers...
@state.push(-1) if $char ~~ "I";
@state.push(-5) if $char ~~ "V";
@state.push(-10) if $char ~~ "X";
@state.push(-50) if $char ~~ "L";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new `verb` code to print `a` is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
llaIaIaIapn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

it works by pushing 50 to the state, pushing 50 again, adding the last two values,
pushing `-1` and then adding three times. Now I want to add some "syntactic sugar"
so that I can subtract and push at the same time.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
# syntactic sugar ...
if $char ~~ "s" { # when we see `s`
  @state.push(-1); # push -1 to the state
  @state.push(@state.pop + @state.pop); # push the last two values of @state
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that should shorten our print `a` program to:

```{.block}
llassspn
```

But our original goal was to print "Hello, World!" so lets get the codes for each of those letters using a little bit of `perl6`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
my @hello = split '', "Hello, world!";
@hello.map({.ord});
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that will tell us the codes for each letter we want to input, that turns our
`Hello, World!` program into

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
lxaxaAAp
llaAp
llaxassp
llaxassp
llaxaAp
lVasp
xxaxaAAp
llaxaxasp
llaxaAp
llaxavasp
llaxassp
llap
lXaXaAAAp
n
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I made our code easier to read by using newlines to show where each letter was
written. I think we can improve on it by making a verb that pushes 100 for us.
`@state.push(100) if $char ~~ "c";` ... `@state.push(-100) if $char ~~ "C";`.
Let's shorten our verb code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
lxaxaAAp
cAp
cxassp
cxassp
cxaAp
lVasp
xxaxaAAp
cxaxasp
cxaAp
cxavasp
cxassp
cp
lXaXaAAAp
n
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, let's add some other operators, `-` for subtraction, `\*` for multiplication,
`/` for division, `%` for modulo/remainder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
if $char ~~ "-" { #subtract
  @state.push(@state.pop - @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "*" { #multiply
    @state.push(@state.pop * @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "/" { #divide
    @state.push(@state.pop / @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "%" { #modulo/remainder
    @state.push(@state.pop % @state.pop);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that because it pops the latest value first that means if you want to
divide by 10 by 5 you have to `v` first then `x%`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
xvac%n
xvac*n
xvac/n
xvac-n
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example of the operators with 15 and 100. The first line does `100 % 15`,
the next line does `100 * 15`, then `100/15` and finally `100 - 15`.

Now let's add the ability to do conditions, first we will need some logical
operators like `==, =/=, and, or, <, >, <=, >=, ~~, <=>`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
# logical operators

if $char ~~ "=" { # equality test
    @state.push(@state.pop == @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "!" { # inequality test
    @state.push(@state.pop != @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "&" { # and
    @state.push(@state.pop && @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "<" { # less than
    @state.push(@state.pop < @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ ">" { # greater than
    @state.push(@state.pop > @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "_" { # less than or equal to
    @state.push(@state.pop <= @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "g" { # greater than or equal to
    @state.push(@state.pop >= @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "~" { # smart equality test
    @state.push(@state.pop ~~ @state.pop);
}
if $char ~~ "?" { # threeway
    @state.push(@state.pop <=> @state.pop);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can then test it with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
++=n
++!n
++=++=&n
vl<n
vl>n
vv_n
vlgn
lvalva~n
lv?n
vl?n
vv?n
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now lets implement a if statement of sorts... well have the program `die` if
the statement is true and well make a unless statement that kills the program if
the statement isn't true.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
# if/unless die || control flow of program

if $char ~~ "i" { # if verb
  if @state.pop == True {
    die "if die"; # dies if true
  }
}
if $char ~~ "u" { # unless verb
  unless @state.pop == True {
    die "unless die" # dies if false
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can test it with this program:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
vc=u
vc=i
lxavapn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It should die, and tell us it was a `u` verb that killed it... then if you see,
`A` the program didn't work.

Now let's say I want to write a program that is actually useful... like a
program that can do synthetic division on polynomials... well let's try it out.

First I'll try writing the program in a more user friendly language, `perl6`...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
my @polynomial = 1, 5, 6;
my $div = -3;

sub divide {
  say ((((@polynomial[0] * $div) + @polynomial[1]) * $div) + @polynomial[2]);
}

divide;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now lets look at what we need to do, first we need to start are program with the
state of the polynomial. So let's change state to `my @state = 6, 5, 1;` since
our language tends to do things backwards. Then we'll use this code. `Iss*aIss*an`
to divide `x^2 +5x +6` (which in factored form is `(x+3)(x+2)`). It should return
`0` since `x-3=0` means `x=3` so if we input `-3` then it will say `0` because
it is a zero. If you think changing the state is cheating then we can just add
the code `+vav+`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.block}
+vav+
Iss*aIss*an
+vav+
Is*aIs*an
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That code checks for both factors and returns zero, if you want you could even
check for equality afterwards and then have the program `die` if it works.

I think that is all for today, if you want to check out the final, completed language
