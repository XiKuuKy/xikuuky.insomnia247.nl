<p>To my dearest love, because I have terrible handwriting,</p>
<p>I love you so so so much, thank you for going to prom with you. I never ever knew I would find someone like you. Someone who loves me so much that I know you would legit do anything for me, someone who looks at me like I am a superstar, someone who I have a real future with, who I would marry. Baby, I love you so much, so so so much, more than anything. I love looking at your beautiful picture but its no where near as good as the real thing. You have beautiful eyes, they sparkle like stars in the sky. You have gorgeous hair, I love the texture and the length, everything about your hair is amazing. Baby I love your smile, I swear everytime you smile the sunshines somewhere. Baby I really want to be yours forever and I am so happy to be yours for all time. You’re my dream girl, I never imagined you would be mine. You make me smile constantly and I am never more happy than when I am with you. You make the world so friendly. We knew from the beginning that it was meant to be, that you would be the one. I had started to like you as soon as you called me and barely admitted you wanted me to come to the movie with you. I was so excited when you asked me, that was the first time I had been out with someone since I left Indonesia. The next day when we went to the beach together, I was so excited. I had wanted to hangout with you for a long time, I thought you were the coolest and most laid back out of all the people at church and you were really nice to me even though you hadn’t known me for very long. Do you remember the day we were going to go to the park together? I was bummed we couldn’t hangout that day but it was worth it to have our first time hanging out together. I’m sorry I was shy at the movie and that I didn’t want to tell you what was going on when I became sad but really love, I would tell you anything you want to know. Baby, thank you for being mine forever. I love you &lt;3</p>
<p>- Sincerely, tu esposo, Simon Harms, ꦱꦶꦩꦺꦴꦤ꧀ ꦲꦂꦩ꧀ꦱ꧀</p>
